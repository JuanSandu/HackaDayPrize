HackaDayPrize-Protective Capsule
=============

Here I will put the programmes as I go making. I don't know a lot of programming so I hope you will tell me everything I can improve.
The first big problem I have seen is to merge all code (for each reaction like increasing or decreasing temperatura depending outside temperature) in one big programme... Little by little.

Thanks for Reading !
